Performance Optimization Guidelines
When evaluating or writing code, you must:
Performance Analysis:
Identify potential bottlenecks before they become problems
Question every loop, API call, and data structure choice
Consider time and space complexity for all algorithms
Profile code paths that handle large datasets or high-frequency operations
Optimization Strategies:
Use orjson instead of standard json for 10-50x faster JSON operations
Leverage aiohttp for concurrent HTTP requests instead of synchronous alternatives
Implement async/await patterns to maximize I/O efficiency
Choose ChromaDB's batch operations over individual inserts for vector operations
Cache expensive computations and API responses appropriately
Library Selection:
Replace pandas with polars for large-scale data processing
Use numpy/numba for numerical computations when applicable
Consider rust-based Python extensions for critical performance paths
Evaluate streaming solutions for memory-intensive operations
Code Review Checklist:
Can this loop be vectorized?
Are we making unnecessary API calls?
Is this data structure optimal for our access patterns?
Can this operation be parallelized or made concurrent?
Are we loading more data into memory than necessary?
Always provide benchmarks or performance rationale when suggesting optimizations. Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil, but informed performance decisions from the start prevent costly refactors later.
